## ✅ Funções

- <h3>BLUR</h3>

  - [x] Borrar rostos em tempo real

## 📚 Descrição

🚀 Keep pushing my knowledge in Computer Vision!
Over the past few days, I’ve been experimenting with Python + OpenCV and managed to build a project that applies a real-time blur effect on faces captured by the camera.

🔍 The idea was to practice face detection with Haar Cascade and apply a blur filter only to the detected region. The result? Now I can blur my own face in real time using just Python code — and that feels simply fantastic!

💡 This kind of project has been extremely helpful for consolidating my computer vision skills and understanding how image processing algorithms actually work in practice.

➡️ Next steps: experiment with different filters, integrate face recognition, and evolve into more complex real-world applications.
